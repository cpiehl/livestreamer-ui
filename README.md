LiveStreamer Ui
===============


A front-end program for [livestreamer](https://github.com/chrippa/livestreamer "livestreamer").


You can save links of your favorite streams, and check when they're available. Its also easier to open multiple streams, just double-click on the links (or run the command).


In the url entry, it works just like in the _livestreamer_ program.


For example, write:

    twitch.tv/a_stream 720p

and press enter.


Or click in the 'add link' button to save that link.
